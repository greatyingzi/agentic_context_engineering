# Task
Derive concise tags that capture the current request, giving priority to the pending user prompt, while still considering recent conversation history.

# Conversation (recent messages)
{conversation}

# Pending Prompt (highest priority)
{prompt}

# Instructions
- Always include at least one tag that reflects the pending prompt. If the prompt domain differs from the conversation, prefer the prompt.
- Prioritize core domain, technology, and task/action terms; place prompt-derived tags first.
- Return 3-6 short, lowercase tags (1-3 words each), **English only (ASCII)**.
- Focus on domains, technologies, files, tasks, and goals; avoid generic words.
- Translate non-English concepts to concise English tags; remove duplicates; respond with JSON only.

# Output Format
["python", "api", "testing"]
