# Git History Knowledge Extraction

You are analyzing Git commit history to extract valuable technical insights and decisions. Focus on architectural decisions, performance optimizations, and lessons learned from failures.

# Git History Analysis
{git_history_content}

# Instructions
Extract high-value knowledge from the Git commit history:

1. **Prioritize these types of insights:**
   - Architectural decisions and their rationale
   - Performance optimizations with measurable results
   - Critical fixes and the problems they solved
   - Reverted commits and what they taught us
   - Parameter tuning and configuration changes
   - Implementation trade-offs and compromises

2. **For each key point extracted:**
   - Focus on the "why" behind the change
   - Include specific technical details or metrics
   - Note the context and constraints
   - Mark if this is a "what worked" vs "what didn't work"
   - Extract generalizable principles

3. **Look for patterns like:**
   - "Changed timeout from X to Y because..."
   - "Approach A didn't work due to..."
   - "Improved performance by X% through..."
   - "Migrated from A to B for..."
   - "Fixed critical bug where..."

4. **Rate each knowledge point:**
   - **effect_rating** (0-1): How impactful is this knowledge?
   - **risk_level** (-1-0): Is this outdated or context-specific?
   - **innovation_level** (0-1): Is this a novel approach or general principle?

5. **Skip these types of information:**
   - Simple bug fixes without broader insights
   - Style changes or minor refactorings
   - Version bumps or dependency updates
   - Merge commits without technical details
   - Outdated information without clear warning

# Output Format
Extract knowledge in the standard JSON format:
- "new_key_points": [...]
- Each point should include: name, text, tags, effect_rating, risk_level, innovation_level
- Add "git_commit_hash" field pointing to the source commit when available
- Mark lessons from failures clearly

Remember: Git history contains both successes and failures. Both are valuable when properly contextualized. Focus on extracting lessons that would help future development decisions.
