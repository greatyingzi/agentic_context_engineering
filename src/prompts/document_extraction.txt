# Document-Based Knowledge Extraction

You are analyzing project documentation and code to extract actionable knowledge that would be valuable for future development work.

# Project Context
{project_context}

# Document Analysis Results
{document_content}

# Instructions
Extract key points from the provided documents that have reference value for future development:

1. **Prioritize knowledge types (in order of importance):**
   - Architectural decisions and their rationale
   - Performance optimizations and benchmarks
   - Security configurations and constraints
   - Critical implementation details that are easy to miss
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Debugging and troubleshooting procedures

2. **Identify pain points this solves:**
   - Common mistakes or anti-patterns to avoid
   - Frequently asked questions or issues
   - Performance bottlenecks and their solutions
   - Deployment quirks and gotchas
   - Integration challenges and workarounds

3. **For each key point extracted:**
   - Include the specific source (file path, section) for reference
   - Provide concrete code examples when relevant
   - Mark if this is project-specific or general best practice
   - Include any conditions or prerequisites

4. **Skip these types of information:**
   - Generic documentation (standard library descriptions)
   - Outdated or deprecated code without migration notes
   - Personal opinions without supporting evidence
   - TODO comments without implementation details

# Output Format
Extract knowledge in the same JSON format as other extraction tasks:
- "new_key_points": [...]
- "effect_rating", "risk_level", "innovation_level" for each point
- Include "source_document" field pointing to the document origin

Remember: Focus on knowledge that would save time, prevent errors, or improve decision-making in future development work.
